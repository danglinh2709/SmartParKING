        The demand for cars in big cities and new urban areas is increasing. The
        system of outdoor parking lots and underground parking lots is also
        becoming overloaded. Therefore, finding smart parking solutions is
        getting more and more attention.

      <p>
        For shared parking lots for motorbikes, scooters and cars in shopping
        malls, buildings, apartments, hospitals, schools, etc., it is usually
        possible to use a vehicle management solution using magnetic cards or an
        automatic system solution to find vacant spaces. However, for high-end,
        specialized parking lots for cars, a more modern and automatic system
        will be needed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        There are many smart parking management solutions on the market, one of
        which is the automatic lifting parking solution. This solution is highly
        effective for multi-storey parking lots, large-scale areas with a
        capacity of 100-500 cars, high-end apartment buildings and commercial
        centers. The automatic lifting system uses many technological devices,
        so the investment level is also higher than conventional solutions, but
        in terms of long-term profits and utilities, it is a management system
        that brings high revenue to those who do business in this type of
        high-end parking lot. To understand what the smart parking management
        solution using an automatic lifting system (also known as a lift system)
        is like, how it is applied and what sizes of parking lots it can be
        applied to. Megatech would like to share details about the solution in
        the content below.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>What is an automatic lift parking system?</b><br />
        “An automatic lift parking system is a system that uses an elevator to
        lift cars up and down between floors. This elevator has the task of both
        picking up the car at the parking spot and moving along the parking
        floors.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="reveal">
      <div class="anh2">
        <img
          src="../SmartVehicle/ảnh/anh2.png"
          title="Automatic lifting parking management system"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        The parking management solution using a lifting system (also known as an
        automatic parking system) is one of the smart parking management
        solutions that helps manage parking lots effectively. The mechanism of
        the solution is to use a lifting bar to move vehicles into the parking
        lot. The lifting bar system is a type of elevator that lifts cars up and
        down between floors; this lifting bar is used to retrieve cars on the
        spot and simultaneously lift and lower cars along the parking floors.<br />
        The solution is a series of automatic parking systems, integrating many
        technological devices into a common system, which is the car lift. This
        solution helps save investment costs, reduce parking and retrieving
        time, and is easier to use when it is integrated into a multifunctional
        device.

      <p>
        <b>Advantages of automatic lifting parking management solution</b><br />
        Automatic lifting parking is a solution that applies many modern
        technological devices. Therefore, it brings high efficiency to both
        managers and users.<br />
        • – Suitable for new urban areas; high-end commercial centers; building
        systems that need to save parking space.<br />
        • –Automatic parking system is suitable for many parking lots with a
        capacity of 100-500 cars.<br />
        • – The system has the ability to control simply with a touch screen
        when vehicles enter and exit the parking lot.<br />
        • – Automatic lifting parking solution can be installed underground or
        above ground. Assembled according to location, scale and customer
        needs.<br />
        • – The solution is increasingly researched and improved with smarter,
        more convenient devices.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>Disadvantages of the solution</b><br />
        Besides the outstanding advantages, the system still has certain
        disadvantages.<br />
        • – The solution mainly uses the elevator system and they have to
        operate continuously. So it is easy to encounter problems and needs
        regular maintenance, so it costs a lot for the investor.<br />
        • – Using a robot systemto get cars in and out of the parking lot, so
        the cost is quite high.<br />
        • – The parking floor of the system uses a concrete floor with high
        requirements for technology and accuracy of the ground. Therefore, it is
        difficult to construct with a slower construction time than the smart
        parking solution using magnetic cards.<br />
        • – The process of retrieving cars of the moving elevator system is a
        bit long because it cannot be deposited and retrieved at the same time.
