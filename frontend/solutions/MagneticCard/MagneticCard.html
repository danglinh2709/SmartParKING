      <h2>INTRODUCTION TO SMARTPARKING PARKING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Smartparking smart parking management system uses magnetic card access
        control technology for transportation systems, cars, motorbikes, using
        technological devices to replace human power. Brings convenience, safety
        and accuracy in parking lot security management.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The system allows for automatic and faster ticket recording and access
        control. Information recorded includes license plate numbers, vehicle
        card numbers, vehicle tickets, vehicle photos, vehicle photos, parking
        lot photos, etc. At the same time, using the software system helps
        managers operate the parking lot more easily. Reports on the number of
        vehicles entering and exiting, revenue control for the parking lot, and
        many other utilities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p><b>Working principle</b></p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Vehicles entering the parking lot will be issued a magnetic card (also
        known as RFID) that has been registered in the system. When swiping the
        card, the Barrier will open, the camera will capture the license plate
        and analyze it into numbers. The card number and license plate will be
        stored simultaneously with the image of the driver taken by the second
        camera for query when necessary. The time the vehicle enters is
        calculated when the card is swiped and is the basis for calculating the
        parking time.
      </p>

        />
      </div>
      <p>
        <b>Entrance </b>: The guard will take a card, swipe it with the card
        reader and give it back to the guest. The system will then take a photo
        of the license plate and the exterior. The license plate is recognized
        in text form combined with card parameters, entry and exit date and
        time, and vehicle driver to create a database stored on the access
        management system.

      </div>
      <p>
        <b>Exit</b> : the staff will collect the customer's card or the customer
        will use his/her card to swipe it on the card reader. The system will
        take a photo of the license plate and the whole scene to identify the
        license plate. The software will automatically compare it with the
        license plate when entering and exiting to check if the parameters are
        valid or not. If the number is incorrect, the system will automatically
        send a warning signal to the staff. If correct, the software will
        display the payment amount.

          >Advantages of smart parking solutions compared to traditional parking
          methods</b
        >
      </p>
      <br />
      <p><b>Traditional parking has many disadvantages:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          – Staff manually records parking information. Use paper or write
          directly on the vehicle for control. This traditional way of parking
          has many disadvantages in terms of time and safety.
        </li>
        <li>– Causes traffic congestion, especially during peak periods.</li>
        <li>
          – Not very secure as tickets can be easily counterfeited, resulting in
          vehicle theft.
        </li>
        <li>
          – Difficult to control revenue and a lot of data because it is only
          recorded manually.
        </li>
        <li>
          – Traditional parking methods are only used in small motorbike parking
          lots and are not suitable for new, modern urban areas.
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Smart parking solution with magnetic cards has many advantages:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          – Regarding performance: using many modern devices helps control more
          closely and quickly .
        </li>
        <li>
          – Automation capability: Using a magnetic card with a unique code that
          is difficult to counterfeit , the image of the license plate and the
          vehicle owner are stored in the system as soon as the driver swipes
          the card. Therefore, the security is higher than traditional methods,
          and the ability to retrieve the vehicle is also faster .
        </li>
        <li>
          – The magnetic card vehicle management system is installed in
          large-scale parking lots such as buildings, apartments, shopping
          centers, etc. It helps parking lot managers save manpower because the
          operating mechanism on the system is the main one and the system
          implementation is also quite simple for the operator.
        </li>
        <li>
          – Smart parking solutions, in addition to security control, also help
          investors manage revenue and business efficiency of parking lots
          during certain periods of time.
        </li>
        <li>
          – Maintenance costs, warranty policy: the ability to install and use
          specialized equipment for smart parking systems has a fairly long
          usage time . Normally, the company that installs this smart system
          will closely monitor and have a separate maintenance policy for each
          parking lot.
        </li>
        <li>
          – Smart parking solution with high professionalism and convenience for
          users .

      <p><b>Disadvantages of the solution</b></p>
      <p>
        Besides the outstanding features, the smart parking solution using
        magnetic cards also has certain limitations that have not been resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        – Ability to find a vacant parking space: in hidden parking lots, it is
        more difficult for drivers to find a parking space, thus wasting time.
      </p>
      <p>
        – For basement car parks, it is necessary to combine smarter equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        – Using magnetic cards can still be counterfeited if the system software
        is hacked.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>BASIC EQUIPMENT OF SMART PARKING SYSTEM</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        A complete smart parking system will include full camera control
        equipment, card readers, cabins, computer systems, automatic barriers,
        sensors, etc. However, depending on the scale of the parking lot,
        certain equipment can be replaced to save costs for the investor. But in
        general, the system needs to ensure the following basic equipment:

    <div class="reveal">
      <p>System cabinet, security lock</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          – With smart parking management solutions using magnetic cards and
          barcodes, the first device to consider is the equipment cabinet (also
          known as a cabin or security booth). The cabinet is designed in many
          different forms to suit each parking location.
        </li>
        <li>
          – Main function: contains computer and software system for parking
          management. Without computer and system, the solution cannot work.
        </li>
        <li>
          – The computer and server systems will be consulted and implemented by
          the installation department to suit each parking lot model.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>Parking lot surveillance camera</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          – Smart parking lot camera system includes license plate camera and
          panoramic camera.
        </li>
        <li>
          – License plate camera type: specializes in reading and recording
          license plate parameters, so it is required in the smart parking
          management system. It can clearly see license plates in different
          lighting conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          – Panoramic camera type: control of drivers, overall entry and exit of
          the parking lot gate area. Depending on the size of the parking lot,
          it may or may not be necessary.

      <p><b>Card and Card Reader (Magnetic card parking machine)</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          – Function: like a regular ticket, the magnetic card helps control
          access to the parking lot.
        </li>
        <li>
          – Card readers are divided into 2 types: fixed card readers (usually
          used for motorbikes and motorcycles) and remote card readers (used for
          cars).
        </li>
        <li>
          – How it works: Depending on each smart parking model, the appropriate
          number of card readers will be used to bring efficiency to the parking
          management system.
        </li>
      </ul>

          – Model of 1 computer managing 2 independent lanes uses 2 card readers
        </li>
        <li>
          – Model of 1 computer managing 2 lanes for cars and motorbikes, use 1
          card reader for all types of vehicles or use separate card readers for
          each type of vehicle.
        </li>
        <li>
          – Model of 1 computer managing 3 or 4 lanes, use 2 card readers or use
          separate card readers for each type of vehicle.

    <div class="reveal">
      <p>Barrier gate (barrier bar)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Function: Barrier acts as an effective barrier gate for smart parking
          systems . This device helps reduce the speed of vehicles entering and
          exiting the parking lot to control the security and order of the
          parking lot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Depending on the size of the parking lot, this device will be used.
          Because with small parking lots of less than 200 cars, it is not
          necessary to use barrier equipment to save costs for the investor. But
          with large parking lots with high traffic volume, this device is
          needed to provide a complete solution.
        </li>
        <li>
          How it works: The barrier is installed right in front of the parking
          lot entrance/exit gate. When the vehicle owner swipes the card, the
          barrier will automatically open and allow the vehicle to move in/out.

          – Device function: usually connected to barrier devices to bring
          effective management to smart parking lots. Similar to barrier
          devices, safety sensors may not need to be used for small-scale
          parking lots or at the request of the investor. But basically, the
          parking system should use this device to ensure effective management
          solutions.

      <h2><b>MODELS OF USING SMART PARKING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</b></h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The smart parking lot model is divided into different lanes. Using the
        management system for each lane makes it easy to control vehicles
        entering and exiting depending on the size, terrain, and type of vehicle
        entering and exiting the parking lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parking lots have separate entrance and exit gates (or multiple gates),
        each gate will use a separate computer for management and between these
        systems, these computers need to be connected to a LAN network to
        operate together.

      </div>
      <p>
        System data can be saved on 1 computer in any lane, however, to increase
        system stability and ensure the most basic model of the smart parking
        solution, it is recommended to use 01 separate PC (or Server) as the
        Data Storage Server.

          >Each parking lot will have different terrain and location
          characteristics, so the design will also correspond to each different
          area. Normally, each computer will manage 1 lane, but there are cases
          where 1 computer can manage 2, 3, 4 different lanes. But in general,
          there are 4 basic smart parking models below and almost all models
          have their own variations.</b
