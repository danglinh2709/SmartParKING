        When it comes to smart parking systems, you will definitely think of a
        professional vehicle access control system extracted by magnetic cards.
        That's right, this is a vehicle management model that is widely
        replicated and highly valued because of the value and efficiency it
        brings. We are committed to safety and the use of modern control
        equipment when using the Megaparking management system.

          >Overview of smart vehicle access control system solution using
          magnetic cards and cameras</b
        ><br />
        Smart vehicle access control system uses magnetic card technology
        combined with specialized surveillance cameras. The solution combines
        many devices such as camera systems, cabins, software, automatic
        barriers. The devices are installed and operated according to a certain
        principle.

        <b>Operating principle of vehicle entry and exit control solution</b
        ><br />
        Vehicles entering and exiting the control area will be issued a magnetic
        card that has been registered in the system. When swiping the card, the
        barrier device automatically opens and the license plate camera records
        the information and analyzes it into data. The card number and license
        plate will be stored simultaneously with the driver's image taken by the
        second camera for query when necessary. The time the vehicle enters is
        calculated when the card is swiped and is the basis for calculating
        parking time.

    <div class="reveal">
      <p>
        <b>Entrance</b>: The guard will take a card, swipe it on the card reader
        and give it to the guest. The system will then take a photo of the
        license plate and the exterior. The license plate is recognized as text
        combined with card parameters, entry and exit date and time, and the
        driver to create a database stored on the entry and exit management
        system. Exit : The staff will collect the guest's card or the guest will
        use his own card to swipe it on the card reader. The system will take a
        photo of the license plate and the entire scene to identify the license
        plate. The software automatically compares it with the license plate at
        the time of entry and exit to check if the parameters are valid. If the
        number is incorrect, the system will automatically send a warning signal
        to the staff. If correct, the software will display the payment amount.
