    <li>– The staff inserts the card into the card scanner to integrate the data on the smart magnetic card chip. This is like each magnetic card is a customer ID. Of course, that is also the only ID code that the customer has.</li>
    <li>– The entire operation takes about 03 seconds. It does not waste effort, does not take too much time but is highly effective.</li>
  </ul>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Outgoing lane:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>– The customer hands over the magnetic card to the staff to scan the card into the card reader. Let the computer compare it with the original license plate number.</li>
    <li>– When there is no discrepancy and the information is valid, the barrier automatically opens for the customer.</li>
