        <p>
          Smart parking solution with automatic vacancy notification system is one of the parking solutions at Smartparking. Effective solution for car parking lots. The solution is designed to combine access control technology with magnetic cards and location notification system in the parking lot. With a professional and modern management system; suitable solution for car parking models in the basement of buildings and apartments.
<br><br>
          Currently, with conventional parking lots for cars, it takes a lot of time to find a parking space, or there is a situation where cars enter the lot but there is no vacancy. This situation is time-consuming and annoying for vehicles as well as parking lot managers. Based on this situation, we have designed and built a smart parking model with an automatic vacancy notification system. The solution combines many smart and systematic control devices. Bringing high efficiency to entry and exit activities in the parking lot.
        </p>
<br>
          <span >OVERVIEW OF AUTOMATIC PARKING SOLUTION TO FIND VACANT SPACES</span>
        <p>The system uses magnetic card access control technology combined with a vacant space notification device and smart parking guidance. With the function of the system reporting the status of whether the parking lot has a space or not, to avoid wasting time when entering and exiting the parking lot and parking quickly.
          <br>
          The automatic parking lot solution finds a location, also known as the parking guidance system, the basement vacancy notification system. This is a solution applied to the basement of many current building, apartment and office parking lots.
          <br>
          This system is fully automatic, uses sensor technology for each location and allows for accurate notification of the number of vacant spaces in each specific area and basement. At the same time, it guides the driver to find a parking space as quickly as possible through sensors installed at each parking location.
        </p>
        <span>Working principle</span>
        <p>When the driver enters the checkpoint, the driver will visually observe information about the parking status, which spaces are available, displayed on the electronic board located right at the checkpoint. Here, based on this display, the operator can advise and guide the driver to park the vehicle in the most convenient space.</p>

          class="anh"
        />
        <p class="b">Operating principle of automatic parking system</p>
<p>In case the driver does not pay attention or does not have the overall information about the number of vacant parking spaces in the parking areas, the driver will be able to observe the information displayed on the LED board about directions, the indicator lights about the status of the parking spots with or without cars in the current area to quickly and easily determine a reasonable parking location.</p>

<span>System Features</span>
<ul>
  <li>Display accurate information about the status of vacant spaces in the parking lot</li>
  <li>Support drivers to find parking spaces as quickly as possible</li>
  <li>The system is continuously and instantly updated with information about the number of vacant spaces in the parking area. Help managers plan and operate the parking lot in a reasonable and effective manner.</li>
</ul>
<span>Details of the basement vacancy notification system</span>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The automatic parking solution</span> basically operates based on the principle of access control using RFID technology, improved with other devices to improve the efficiency of the parking lot for both supervisors and customers. The automatic smart parking management system includes access control devices and parking guidance systems.</p>
  <span>Access control devices</span>
  <p>These are devices installed and operated at the parking lot control station. Similar to the basic magnetic card parking solution. This control station will include devices connected together according to a certain process to ensure the operating principle and stable operation.</p>

  <span>Management software</span>
<p>• > The software is the main management place of the parking control system 
 <br> • > With this solution, the system will use Smartparking management software. The software has been researched and operated based on smart RFID technology
 <br> • > The software has the feature of helping to manage and monitor the system based on the working computer interface.
 <br>  • > The function helps to determine the location and parking space information on the software interface.
 <br>  • > Has the ability to synthesize reports and retrieve data in the management software system.
 <br>  • > Connects to controllers and other devices in the system.
 <br>  • > Uses SQL database to store more information, more secure.
 <br>  Surveillance camera
 <br>  • – Automatic parking surveillance camera includes panoramic camera and license plate camera.
 <br>  • – License plate camera has the function of reading and recording information about license plate. The types of license plate cameras commonly used are IP cameras, HD cameras, infrared cameras to capture clear images of information for more security and to avoid risks.
 <br>  • – Panoramic cameras with the function of controlling information on vehicle types, drivers, and the entire area entering and exiting the checkpoint for more security. Information can be retrieved for checking in certain cases. This type of device may not be needed in different parking lot models, depending on the usage needs.
  Card reader
  <br>  • – Use long-range cards and long-range RFID card readers. Because the solution is applied to cars. Therefore, long-range card readers are used to bring convenience to the driver
  Automatic barriers and speed bumps
  <br>  • – Automatic parking lots that find locations often use barriers and speed bumps to increase security and bring more professionalism to the parking lot.
  Accessories
  <br>   • – Depending on the size of the parking lot, additional supporting accessories can be used to bring higher efficiency and modernity.</p>
<span>Parking Guidance System</span>
<p>The parking system is divided into separate parking spots. At each spot, a sensor will be installed, this sensor helps determine the current status of that parking spot (with or without a car). Along with that is an LED device that displays the status (a green light indicates that the spot is empty, and a red light indicates that the spot is occupied). Those sensors will be connected to the zone controller (ZCU)</p>

  <li><span>Parking position sensor
  </span> <ul>
  • – LED direction boards will be placed at the turns in the parking lot, the total LED display board will be placed at the entrance and exit control points. <br>
• – The central processing unit (CCU) is connected to the regional controllers and from there gets the status information of the parking lots to display the LED boards <br>
• – Function: display information about the license plate or the payment amount when the vehicle enters or exits or can display instructions in the waiting state. <br>
• – How it works: Connect to the computer via COM or TCP/IP port <br>
• – Outdoor LED board: installed right at the control gate of the basement parking lot. To notify the system whether there are any vacant spaces or not. To avoid wasting time when entering the parking lot if there are no more parking spaces in the lot
