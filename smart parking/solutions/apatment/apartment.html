    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">First step</span>: with the arrangement of
      LED signs right outside the entrance gate. When the car arrives at the
      parking garage, the vehicle owner will know if there is a vacant parking
      space. This is known through the signal parameters on the LED sign; the
      sign is always updated thanks to the installed system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Next step</span>: when entering the
      garage, the vehicle swipes the card normally and arrives at the parking
      lot. The sensor system is installed at each parking location. If there is
      no car, the light will signal green, and if there is a car parked, the
      light will signal red. The solution brings convenience when you do not
      have to go around looking for a parking spot or ask the staff.
